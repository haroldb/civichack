<h1>About us</h1>

<p>This website aims to allow tenants to rate their rental properties so that other potential tenants can see this rating when looking to rent a property. The rating is based upon 5 categories: location, time to respond to problems, quality of the solutions, communication with the landlord and initial property condition.
</p>

<p>Please do not rate in extremes unless appropriate.</p>
